# Popularity-Based-Recommendation-System-User-Cold-Start-Problem

What will happen if a new user or a new item is added in the dataset?

It is called a <b>COLD START.</b> In this project we done the coding of Popularity Based Recommendation System and try to solve the problem to USER COLD START.

- User Cold Start
  * means that a user is introduced in the datset. Since there is no history of that user. So one basic approach could be to apply a popularity based strategy i.e. recommend the most popular web series.

  * Load the dataset i.e. a dictionary 
  * function to extract unique movies from the dataset
  * function to fetch trending movies in the dataset
